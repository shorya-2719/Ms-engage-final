# Ms-engage-final
This is a project that I have created for the microsoft engage mentee program. I have used firebase as a server .It has been implemented using webRTC and web development languages like HTML,CSS and javaScript .Some Jquery has also been used but only upto a minimal extent. To run the project download the zip folder and extract it into a new folder/ directory.
