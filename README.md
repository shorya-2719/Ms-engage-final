# Ms-engage-final
This is a project that I have created for the microsoft engage mentee program. I have used firebase as a server .It has been implemented using webRTC and web development languages like HTML,CSS and javaScript .Some Jquery has also been used but only upto a minimal extent. To run the project download the zip folder and extract it into a new folder/ directory. Then through the terminal navigate to that directory and folder and use the code given below to start your project on localhost 3000.I have also hosted it on web and the link is given below.It isn't working properly but I hope to set that up in the future.

Code used to set up                                                                                                                                                                 
npm install
